pam_securetty — Limit root login to special devices

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the user is
logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing in the securetty file.
pam_securetty checks at first, if /etc/securetty exists. If not and it was
built with vendordir support, it will use <vendordir>/securetty. pam_securetty
also checks that the securetty files are plain files and not world writable. It
will also allow root logins on the tty specified with console= switch on the
kernel command line and on ttys from the /sys/class/tty/console/active.

This module has no effect on non-root users and requires that the application
fills in the PAM_TTY item correctly.

For canonical usage, should be listed as a required authentication method
before any sufficient authentication methods.

OPTIONS

noconsole

    Do not automatically allow root logins on the kernel console device, as
    specified on the kernel command line or by the sys file, if it is not also
    specified in the securetty file.
