pam_chksshpwd — Checks to see if SSH is available using the default password

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_chksshpwd is a PAM module that checks to see if SSH is enabled,
and if so checks to see if the default password is unchanged. If 
SSH is enabled with password authentication, and the default
password for the "pi" user is still "raspberry", the file
/var/lib/chksshpwd/sshwarn is created.

If SSH logins are not possible with the default user account and
password, this file is deleted if it exists.

EXAMPLES

The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/common-session is:

session  optional  pam_chksshpwd.so
