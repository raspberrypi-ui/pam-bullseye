pam_usertype — check if the authenticated user is a system or regular account

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_usertype.so is designed to succeed or fail authentication based on type of
the account of the authenticated user. The type of the account is decided with
help of SYS_UID_MIN and SYS_UID_MAX settings in /etc/login.defs. One use is to
select whether to load other modules based on this test.

The module should be given only one condition as module argument.
Authentication will succeed only if the condition is met.

OPTIONS

The following flags are supported:

use_uid

    Evaluate conditions using the account of the user whose UID the application
    is running under instead of the user being authenticated.

audit

    Log unknown users to the system log.

Available conditions are:

issystem

    Succeed if the user is a system user.

isregular

    Succeed if the user is a regular user.

EXAMPLES

Skip remaining modules if the user is a system user:

account sufficient pam_usertype.so issystem
